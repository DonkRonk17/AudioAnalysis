# AudioAnalysis - Visual Branding Prompts

**Tool Purpose:** Enable AI agents to "listen" and analyze audio content through voltage gauge approach.

**Style Guide:** Beacon HQ Visual System v1

## LOGO (Primary Icon)

### Prompt for DALL-E/Midjourney:

```
Professional tech logo for "AudioAnalysis" - an AI-powered audio analysis tool.
Design elements: A stylized audio waveform shaped like a voltage meter needle,
with sound waves radiating outward. Clean geometric style with dark blue (#1a1a2e)
background, cyan accent (#4fd1c5) for the waveform, and subtle orange (#ff6b35)
highlight at the peak. Modern, minimalist, vector-style. Logo should convey
"listening" and "measurement" concepts. High contrast, suitable for both light
and dark backgrounds. Include a subtle dB scale indicator. Professional tech
aesthetic, not playful.
```

## ICON (Square/App Icon)

### Prompt for DALL-E/Midjourney:

```
Square app icon for "AudioAnalysis" audio tool. Minimalist design featuring a
stylized analog VU meter or voltage gauge with audio waveform overlay. Color
palette: dark navy background (#1a1a2e), teal/cyan meter indicator (#4fd1c5),
warm orange peak warning (#ff6b35). Clean geometric shapes, no text, suitable
for 512x512px. Modern tech aesthetic with subtle grid pattern in background.
Professional look suitable for developer tool. Think: sound engineering meets
voltage measurement.
```

## BANNER (Header/GitHub)

### Prompt for DALL-E/Midjourney:

```
Wide banner header image for "AudioAnalysis" GitHub repository. Dark tech
aesthetic with gradient from deep navy (#1a1a2e) to dark teal (#0d4d4d). 
Feature a large stylized audio waveform that transforms into voltage readings
on the right side. Include subtle grid overlay suggesting measurement precision.
Accent colors: cyan (#4fd1c5) for the waveform, orange (#ff6b35) for peaks.
Clean, professional, modern. Text space on left third for title. 1280x640px
aspect ratio. Suitable for README header or social sharing.
```

## CONCEPT DIAGRAM

### Description for designer/AI:

```
Conceptual diagram showing the "Voltage Gauge" approach to audio analysis.
Left side: Standard audio waveform representation.
Center: Arrow showing transformation process.
Right side: Voltage meter/gauge with dB readings.
Below: Timeline with activity buckets (colored bars showing high/medium/low).
Color scheme: Dark background, cyan waveform, orange peaks, green for low activity.
Clean infographic style with labels. Show the key concept: audio amplitude as
voltage readings over time.
```
